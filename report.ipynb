    "The first principle we observe is the open/closed principle, this principle ensures that our program is open for extension, but closed for modification. In the reader file, we have DatasetReader class that has an abstract method \"_ _load_data_from_disk_\" which is overwritten in the class BinppReader. The purpose of this program is to ensure that if the program wants to read the data in a different way, it would not need to modify the original method, and it can just change it by just simply extneding the different method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle is again repeated in the offline and online files as well. These 2 files both have sepereate and different classes called NextFit that inherit the abstract methods of Offline and Online from the model class respectively. The abstract methods are both called \"_ _process_\" in both classes Online and Offline, and in each NextFit class, each of these abstract methods are overwritten. This pirnciple again indicates how we just extend to the method without modifying the original version.\n",

    "### Dependency Inversion:\n",
    "Another principle we observed, was the dependency inversion principle. This principle ensures that high level modules do not depend on low-level modules and that abstractions should not depend on details, but vice versa. In the first example, we could observe that the classes NextFit and BenMaier in the files offline and baseline respectively are dependant on the higher level class Offline in the model file. In the Offline class, the abstraction does not depend on the details, however on its subclasses, the details do depend on their abstraction.\n",

    "The next place we could observe this principle is the NextFit class in the online file which depends on the Online class of the model file. Similar to the occurence above, the Online class is at a higher level and is not dependant on the lower level classes such as NextFit, however the details on the NextFit class depend on the abstraction in the higher level."

The algorithm will first discover the heurestic of each of the weight in each iteration. Each of the weights, based on their heurestics could then be placed in different bins as well. The bins of type A,B,C,D will correspond to the weight heurestics A,B,C,D. Each weight that will enter the iteration will first implement the online FirstFit implemntation on the A bin, then then B bin, then the C bin, and finally the D bin. If they weight cannot be placed in any of the previously made bin, it will create a new bin that will correspond to its own heurestics, for instance a weight A that does not fit in any of the previously made bins, will create a new bin of class A. After going through all the iterations of the bins, the algorithm will then add all of bins of types A,B,C,D into the solution format which will include the sum the bin's content as well."

    "After implementing the pyperf library to benchmark our dataset, we observed that the runtime complexity for the multifit algorithm is k * O(n^2) due to the implementation of the FirstFit decreasing algorithm. Unfortunately we were not able to implement our KPIs from the previous benchmarks into this algorithm, because they were not showing an accurate represnetation of the performance. The KPIs that we implemented measure the number of comparisons we had to make with a previous bin, however in the multifit algorithm we are comparing the maximum and capacity values. The largest sum algorithm on the other hand showed a linear time complexity with a much less value execution time compared to the largest sum problem. In addition, the multiway partioning p"
